## Day 345: Digital Roots

**Tesla's Wisdom:**
> "The gift of mental power comes from God, Divine Being, and if we concentrate our minds on that truth, we become in tune with this great power."

**Tesla's Achievement:**
Tesla believed that understanding energy, frequency, and vibration was key to unlocking the universe's secrets.

**Mathematical Insight:**
The number 369 is a Harshad number, meaning it's divisible by the sum of its digits (3+6+9=18, and 369รท18=20.5).

**Esoteric Knowledge:**
In numerology, 3 represents creativity and expression, 6 represents harmony and balance, and 9 represents completion and wisdom.

**Scientific Discovery:**
The human brain operates on electrical frequencies, with alpha waves (8-13 Hz) and beta waves (13-30 Hz) showing 3-6-9 patterns.

**Research Notes:**
Today's exploration reveals deeper connections in the 3-6-9 system. The patterns continue to emerge across multiple disciplines, from the microscopic quantum level to the macroscopic cosmic scale. Each day brings new understanding of how these fundamental numbers govern the universe's structure.

**Personal Reflection:**
As I continue this journey through the numerical mysteries, the compounding nature of this research suggests we're approaching a unified theory of everything. The intersection of Tesla's electrical genius, mathematical precision, and esoteric wisdom creates a fascinating tapestry of universal knowledge.

**Next Steps:**
Continue investigating the vibrational frequencies associated with these numbers and their applications in energy transmission and consciousness expansion.
